# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course. This supports registration of airlines and flights. Passengers can buy insurance as well. In the event a registered flight is delayed, the passenger receives a payout of 1.5 times the
amount of insurance bought.
