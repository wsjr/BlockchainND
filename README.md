### Udacity Blockchain Nanodegree Projects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Project 1: Blockchain Identity and Wallet

Created our own blockchain "identity". Using Electrum.org, we've created a new wallet and wallet address, generated a message and signed the message with our wallet.

#### Project 2: Private Blockchain

Built a private blockchain using Javascript, NodeJs and levelDB to persist the blockchain's state.

#### Project 3: Private Blockchain + Web API

Added Restful Web API on top of our previous private blockchain project using Node.js framework inorder to submit block and retrieve blocks.


#### Project 4: Star Registry

Built a Star Registry service that allows users to claim ownership of their favorite star in the night sky. 
ExpressJS was used to serve Web API on top of our private blockchain. This app validates requests, registers your favorite star and queries stars by wallet address or blockchain hash.

#### Project 5: Decentralized Star Notary

Built a Decentralized Star Notary that allows users to claim ownership of their favorite star in the night sky and deployed on Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network. Users can register/create stars by providing the following properties: id, name, story, and star coordinates namely ra, dec and mag. In addition, Users can find stars by its ID. This application is built using Solidity to built the smart contract, Truffle Suite to compile, deploy and test smart contract, Remix to test smart contracts, OpenZeppelin to make ERC-721 tokens easily.

#### Project 6: Architect a Blockchain Supply Chain Solution

Built UML Diagrams to scope out the behavior and structures of Coconut Supply Chain.


#### Project 7: Coconut Supply chain & data auditing

Built an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Coconut Supply Chain flow which goes from farmer, processor, retailer to consumer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

#### Project 8: Flight Surety

Built an Ethereum DApp that lets passengers buy flight insurances. This also supports registration of airlines and flights. 
In the event a registered flight is delayed, an insured passenger receives a payout of 1.5 times the amount of insurance bought.


#### Project 9: Real Estate Marketplace

Created a custom ERC721Token in which we mint and deply to OpenSea. It uses Zokrates to verify the uniqueness of the token.
