# Build a Private Blockchain Notary Service

This project builds a Star Registry service that allows users to claim ownership of their favorite star in the night sky. It is built using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) that serves as Web API on top of our private blockchain. Our app validates requests, registers your favorite star and queries stars by wallet address or blockchain hash.
